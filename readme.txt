= Why should I use Wurdey? I can do updates on my own. =

For a person to perform all of the maintenance tasks Wurdey performs daily, it would take a considerable amount of time and if paying a developer would cost a fortune.

= What happens if my site breaks during an update? =

We will restore your website to the last backup immediately and contact you for approval to proceed with the next steps to resolve your issue. 

= I am a WordPress developer, why should I use Wurdy? =

As a WordPress developer, you know the importance of keeping WP sites up to date, secure, backed up and free of junk. Not only do we take care of all the tedious work that you never get paid by your customers to perform, we will pay you a hefty monthly residual commission to refer your customers to Wurdey. Why you may ask? Because we were once WordPress developers too and we learned way to fast that there was no money and lots of time wasted on these services.
